# reMarkable Authentication Fix

## Overview
Fixed critical authentication issues with the reMarkable Cloud API integration by correcting API endpoints and implementing proper token refresh functionality.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Incorrect API Base URLs
**Problem:** The application was using outdated Google App Engine URLs that no longer work.

**Before:**
- Auth URL: `https://webapp-production-dot-remarkable-cloud.appspot.com`
- Document URL: `https://document-storage-production-dot-remarkable-cloud.appspot.com`

**After:**
- Device Auth URL: `https://webapp.cloud.remarkable.com`
- User Auth URL: `https://my.remarkable.com`
- Document URL: `https://document-storage.cloud.remarkable.com`

### 2. Missing Authorization Header
**Problem:** Device registration was missing the required empty `Authorization: Bearer` header.

**Fix:** Added `'Authorization': 'Bearer'` header to device registration requests.

### 3. Incorrect Token Refresh Endpoint
**Problem:** User token refresh was using the wrong URL.

**Fix:** Updated to use `https://my.remarkable.com/token/json/2/user/new` for token refresh.

### 4. Frontend Instructions
**Problem:** Users were directed to incorrect URL for obtaining one-time codes.

**Fix:** Updated instructions to direct users to `https://my.remarkable.com/#desktop` with clickable link.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `backend/src/services/remarkableApi.js`
- Updated constructor with correct API URLs
- Fixed device registration to use correct endpoint and headers
- Fixed user token endpoint
- Added `refreshUserToken()` method for token refresh
- Added `getValidUserToken()` method with automatic refresh logic

#### 2. `backend/src/services/remarkableConnection.js`
- Updated `testConnection()` to use token refresh functionality
- Added `storeUserToken()` method for updating refreshed tokens
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### Frontend Changes

#### 3. `frontend/src/components/RemarkableSettings.js`
- Updated instructions to point to correct URL: `https://my.remarkable.com/#desktop`
- Made the URL clickable for better user experience

## Authentication Flow

The corrected authentication flow now works as follows:

1. **User gets one-time code** from `https://my.remarkable.com/#desktop`
2. **Device registration** at `https://webapp.cloud.remarkable.com/token/json/2/device/new`
   - Uses empty `Authorization: Bearer` header
   - Exchanges one-time code for device token
3. **User token generation** at `https://my.remarkable.com/token/json/2/user/new`
   - Uses device token as `Authorization: Bearer` header
   - Gets user token for API access
4. **Token refresh** at `https://my.remarkable.com/token/json/2/user/new`
   - Uses current user token as `Authorization: Bearer` header
   - Gets refreshed user token
5. **API calls** to `https://document-storage.cloud.remarkable.com`
   - Uses refreshed user token for authentication

## Key Features Added

### Automatic Token Refresh
- Tokens are automatically refreshed before API calls
- Refreshed tokens are stored securely in the database
- Fallback to new token generation if refresh fails

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios
- Improved logging for debugging authentication issues
- Graceful handling of token expiration

### User Experience Improvements
- Clickable link to reMarkable authentication page
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Better error feedback in the UI

## Testing

The application has been successfully built and deployed with Docker. The authentication system is now ready for testing with actual reMarkable accounts.

To test:
1. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Follow the updated instructions to get a one-time code
4. Enter the code and test the connection
